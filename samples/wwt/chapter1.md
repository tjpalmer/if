# What We Tell

## Chapter 1

### Start
[Limber](#limber) winds [his way](#way) along [Slick River](#river) toward [Red Stone Valley](#valley).

### Ear

### Fast
Most [Runners](#runner) are faster than most [Hunters](#hunter) and [Movers](#mover), but obviously slower than [Flyers](#flyer) in their unique element. Since Flyers are so [rare](#rare), Runners often make the best couriers.

### Flyer
As they develop from grub state, Flyer arms and fingers grow out, with a large skin membrane attached to their leg on either side.

### Grub
Grubs haven't yet reached puberty and developed into an adult form. Grubs are bipedal with only on top of their heads. Their [hands](#hand) are dexterous with opposable thumbs.

### Hand
[Limber](#limber) looks down at front hooves and remembers the hands he once had. Grubs are often put to work in manufacturing, but of course Limber would have [none of that](#nature) when he was a grub.

### Limber
About average size for a [Runner](#runner), but [faster](#fast) than average, Limber is also missing most of [his right ear](#ear).

### Mover
With their thick legs and large bodies, Movers can carry heavy burdens. Harnessed to pulleys, they excel at construction tasks. Still, they can run at a surprisingly [fast](#fast) pace.

### Nature
As a grub, [Limber](#limber) always swore to [his friends](#friends) that he would never grow up.

### Rare
[Hunters](#hunter), [Movers](#mover), and [Runners](#runner) are about equally common. Usually, the children of a pair of any form matches the form of the parents. Hunter parents have [grubs](#grub) that grow up to be Hunters.
